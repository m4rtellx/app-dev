# Green Inferno
## Overview
The Green Inferno (2013) is a horror film written and directed by Eli Roth. The story centers around a group of student activists who travel to the Amazon rainforest to save an indigenous tribe from deforestation. However, they are captured by the very tribe they sought to protect, leading to a gruesome survival horror as they become the tribe's next victims in a cannibalistic ritual. The film pays homage to the 1970s cannibal genre, particularly Cannibal Holocaust, and is known for its shocking violence and gory scenes.
